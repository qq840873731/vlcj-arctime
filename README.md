vlcj-arctime
====

vlcj-arctime is a fork of vlcj aimed at getting ArcTime to work on modern Linux distributions. 



Building vlcj-arctime
-------------------------------

The project is at the moment built with OpenJDK 8 on Linux. This will
work just fine when using Maven to build the project from the command-line.

When compiling with Maven it is simply not possible to suppress the warnings about using sun.misc.Unsafe.
